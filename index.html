      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <h3>Here's a little introducton about me:</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Juliet Nwosu</strong>. I am a student at AltSchool Africa and
        also a tech newbie. My School ID is <strong>ALT/SOE/023/3364.</strong> <br>I am from Aguata LGA in Anambra
        State. I
        was born on July 19th in the year 2000. I am the second child out of
        three children. I completed my primary and secondary school education
        in Lagos state. <br>
        Afrer my secondary school I proceeded to Enugu state to complete my
        tertiary education. I hold a BSc in Health Education and I am
        TRCN (Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria) certified. <br>
        I am a graduate of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and I am also a certified Health
        Educator. Though my bio is quite short because I am still a work in progress, I believe that I have full

      <h4>Reasons why I am in AltSchool</h4>
      <p>
        Before I chose AltSchool, I made my research because I needed a school
        which would make me develop me skills perfectly with the right support
        and I found AltSchool. <br>
        So the major reason I am in AltSchool is because I needed to expand my
        career prospect and AltSchool is the right vehicle for me in this tech
        journey of mine.
